Brief Description
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

Unlike the models created using URDF (my_wheelchair), the worlds in Gazebo are created using SDF.
When urdf models are imported or spawned into Gazebo, they do become SDFormat, so this is the
accepted model convention in Gazebo. Knowing this, it is import to learn how to work with
the simulator in terms of:

1. Building (Poubel, 2017) and Editing (Silliman, 2015) a world
2. Making an SDF model (MaryaB, 2020) and understanding the specification (osrf, 2014)
3. Applying textures and Materials (GabrielTorre, 2019)
4. Importing (Peters, 2017) and attaching (Chen, 2016) customised SDF models and meshes
   (3D Warehouse, 2020)
5. Implementing collision values and other physics (MartijnBuijs, 2018)
