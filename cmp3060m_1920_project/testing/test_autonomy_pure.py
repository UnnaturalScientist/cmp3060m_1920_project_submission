Brief Description
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

The purpose of this script is to set individual goal states that will allow the robot to reach
the other side of the restaurant with little to no incident. This can be achieved by utilizing
the parameters of the navigation stack to detect obstacles within the given environment and plan
a path that can be completed with the minimal navigation cost. This will be in the context of a
specific map drawn from the map_server.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Imported Clients and Packages
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

rospy is the client library for ros python. The action library provides the ability to broadcast
and listen for goals from the action server/client. These goals are set using the
MoveBaseGoal library and are then communicated to the action server using MoveBaseAciton. This
is passed as an arguement through the SimpleActionClient from the actionlib library.

2. Pose and Orientation
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

In this instance, the robot must follow a series of set goal points to complete a planned path.
An example of designated points are the x and y which are set as (-0.06, 4.70) respectively.
The same applies for the orientation/quaternion coordinates being qz (orientation.z) and qw
(orientation.w), which have been set to 0.70, 1.0. Additionally, is can be noted that z, qx and
qy have been set to zero as default. The reason for this is that the robot only travels along the
x and y plane. Position as a z coordinate refers to elevation/upwards movement. This wheelchair
does not levitate or fly in anyway, z is not required. qx and qy refer to the roll and pitch.
The robot also has no need for these coordinates to access every level of functionality.

    Within this function, the execution of each GoalPoint takes place. As referenced with the

    tailored for robot navigation.
