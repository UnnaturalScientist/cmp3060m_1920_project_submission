Brief Description
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is the sole teloperation script, which is used for study_a and study_c (Blended Control).
There is basic speed selection and forward / rotation functionality. The input source for these
control methods is a wired Xbox 360 Controller.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Imported Clients and Packages
__________________________________________________________________________________________________

rospy is the client library for ros python. The action library provides the ability to broadcast
and listen for goals from the action server/client. These goals are set using the
MoveBaseGoal library and are then communicated to the action server using MoveBaseAciton. This
is passed as an arguement through the SimpleActionClient from the actionlib library.

        2. The Teleoperation Class
        __________________________________________________________________________________________

        The node is initialised as 'teleop_pure' which is what this consists of: only teleop.
        There is no autonomous travel within this script, but there is some simple object detect
        functions for information purposes only. This is in the form of a simple laser scan in the
        local vicinity. This can be noted in the 'scan_callback' and LaserScan subscriber. One
        other subsciber, also part of the sensor_msgs package, would be Joy. This will enable
        input from an xbox controller and publish the commands as twist messages for the robot
        to act upon. mps / metres per second is set at zero, with the option to alter speed by
        increments of 25%. This can reach a maximum of 2 metres per second (4 miles per hour),
        which is the max speed of the Jazzy 6 wheelchair. The rotation of the robot is set at
        1 radian per second, which is also the maximum rotation speed of the Jazzy 6. This means
        the robot would take 3 seconds to perform a 180 degree (approx) turn. Finally, variables
        have been set for the vertical and horizontal functionality of the xbox left thumbstick.

        __________________________________________________________________________________________

        Simple teleoperation functionality. The left thumbstick enables the usage of forward and
        rotational velocities to the robot and provides functionality to 6 of the xbox buttons.
        The four 'letter' based buttons (A, B, X and Y) are used to select 1 of 4 speed settings.
        It is understood that the Jazzy 6 has ten speed settings, but that is not convinient for
        the controller layout and may prove an uneccessary distraction for users. Other than
        these speed settings, the 'shoulder' or 'bumper' buttons, LB and RB, provide a braking
        mechanism for the robot.

    Simple execution, which is slightly different to ROS spin, but has the same general function.
